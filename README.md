UX:

Ideal client
The ideal client for this business is:

Female 
Is getting married or attending a wedding/social event.
Has a disposable income.
Is South Asian or olive skinned.
Wants to look amazing.
Lives in London.
Social media savvy.

This project is the best way to help them achieve these things because:
Based on my research there is a huge variety in the UX standard of other make-up artist's websites, they are often not responsive or out of date.
The majority of werbsites are aimed at European skin tones, this one is specifically for olive skin, and women with Asian ethnicity.
It will allow the customer to book in via phone or generate a quote depending on what they feel more comfortable with.
The make up artist has a large following on social media and as such comes up with bold, unique designs you likely will not be able to replicate elsewhere.

This website is: 
Easy to use and elegant in design. It it aspirational and should conjure up thoughts of what the wedding day will feel like.
Designed to draw attention to the stunning images and the work of the artist.
Concise, all the infromation the client needs is there, without going into unnecessary detail.
Designed to guide the user towards requesting a quote or calling the phone number, at which point finer details can be discussed with the artist.
